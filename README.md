# Step-by-Step NMF Example - My implementation

This NMF program was created to follow the 'Step-by-Step NMF Example in Python' tutorial
from [medium.com](https://medium.com/@quindaly/step-by-step-nmf-example-in-python-9974e38dc9f9) courtesy
of Quin Daly. More details from this implementation can be found in this article.

The book-crossing dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/somnambwl/bookcrossing-dataset?select=Books.csv) 
is used to implement a recommender system using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to improve my own 
understanding of the algorithm. 

This implementation is a faithful recreation of the tutorial - while I wrote this code, it was with heavy reference
to the Quin Daly's work on medium.com
